# Nix flake for the Turbo (`turbo`) terminal AI coding agent.
#
# This flake builds the `turbo` binary (the composition-root crate
# `xai-grok-pager-bin`) and provides a dev shell with all build-time
# tooling. It is written in the same style as an in-tree nixpkgs package
# expression so that the `package` output below can be lifted almost
# verbatim into `pkgs/by-name/hy/hyper-grok-build/package.nix` when
# contributing upstream — only the `import <nixpkgs>` / `lib` plumbing
# differs.
#
# Usage:
#   nix build .#turbo-grok-build        # build the `hyper` binary
#   nix run   .#turbo-grok-build -- --version
#   nix develop                          # rust + protoc + cmake + git shell
#
# The first `nix build` will fail on `cargoLock.outputHashes` for the
# `async-openai` git fork and print the correct SRI hash — copy it into
# `outputHashes` below and rebuild. See:
# https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#buildrustpackage
