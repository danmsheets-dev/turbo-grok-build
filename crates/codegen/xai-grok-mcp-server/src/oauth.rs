//! OAuth 2.1 for clients that cannot send a static bearer header.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! ChatGPT's connector discovers a server's OAuth metadata and registers
//! itself; it never offers to send an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` the
//! operator pasted. The MCP authorization specification makes that flow a
//! resource server's obligation: protected resource metadata (RFC 9728), a
//! `WWW-Authenticate` challenge pointing at it, and tokens validated as issued
//! **for this server** (RFC 8707). `rmcp` 2.1 ships OAuth for the client side
//! only, so everything here is this crate's to write and to audit.
//!
//! # What is trusted, and what is not
//!
//! Four of these endpoints answer before any credential exists, so each is
//! bounded on its own: small bodies, a cap on registered clients and pending
//! codes, single-use codes that expire in a minute, `S256` only, and exact
//! redirect matching. Rejections go through the same throttled operator line as
//! a bad bearer token, so a scan cannot flood the terminal.
//!
//! Consent has no user database to draw on. It binds to the console, which is
//! the trust boundary the bearer token already has: Turbo prints a code, and
//! the browser must return it. The window that code is good for opens when the
//! approval page is served — never at process start, which would make approval
//! impossible on a server that had been running longer — and loading the page
//! again reopens it. Inside that window the code may be used more than once, so
//! a client can be reconnected after a tunnel rebind clears its grant without
//! restarting the server and re-rolling every other credential. Reaching
//! `/oauth/authorize` is not enough to mint a token.
//!
//! Tokens are opaque random strings, never JWTs: there are no signing keys to
//! manage, and the process that issues a token is the only one that validates
//! it. They live in memory and die with the process, exactly as the bearer
//! token does.
//!
//! A token widens nothing. Every call still passes [`crate::guard::PathGuard`],
//! in the tier the operator started; a token is a way in, not a permission.
