//! Speaker playback without maudio.
//!
//! Mirrors the capture backend's platform split (see `crate::audio`): the
//! long-lived TUI never pays a permanent platform-audio-stack memory cost, so
//! playback runs out of process on Linux and macOS, and in-process via `cpal`
//! on Windows (whose WASAPI memory cost is modest).
//!
//! - **Linux**: a subprocess player (`pw-play`/`pacat`/`aplay`) fed raw PCM16
//!   over its stdin.
//! - **Windows**: `cpal` output stream in-process.
//! - **macOS**: a short-lived self-exec `__speaker-play` helper (consistent
//!   with the `__mic-capture` capture memory policy) so CoreAudio's permanent
//!   footprint dies with the helper when the live session ends.
//!
//! The [`PlaybackWriter`] hands mono `f32` samples (48 kHz, the WebRTC output
//! rate) to the backend; each backend converts to the format its player
//! expects. All backends are bounded *by sample count*: a full queue drops the
//! **oldest** samples so playback stays recent rather than accumulating
//! latency, and every backend thread/callback terminates deterministically on
//! stop (no thread is left blocked on a live channel).
//!
//! # Queue design
//! The [`PlaybackQueue`] uses a single `Mutex<VecDeque<f32>>` + `Condvar` so
//! that enqueue (with sample-count shedding), dequeue, and accounting are
//! atomic under one lock — no separate atomic counter that can drift from the
//! actual buffer contents. `write` never blocks: if the queue is over the bound
//! the oldest samples are shed before the new chunk is appended. Chunks larger
//! than the bound are trimmed to the most recent `PLAYBACK_QUEUE_SAMPLES`.
//!
//! This is a substantially original design (no OMP `maudio` dependency); the
//! OMP `PlaybackStream`/`PlaybackWriter` *interface shape* is preserved for
//! ergonomics, but the implementations are platform subprocess/cpal ports. MIT
//! attribution for the borrowed interface in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`.
