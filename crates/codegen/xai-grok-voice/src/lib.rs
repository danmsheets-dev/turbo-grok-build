//! Voice input for Grok Build CLI: an xAI streaming STT client and the
//! [`run_voice_pipeline`] task that emits [`VoiceEvent`]s for the pager.
//!
//! Voice is dictation only: mic → streaming STT → transcript into the prompt
//! box. With the `live` feature, it also drives Codex Live real-time voice
//! sessions via [`live::run_live_session`].
//!
//! On macOS and Linux the microphone is opened in a short-lived subprocess so
//! the long-lived TUI never pays the platform audio stack's permanent memory
//! cost (see [`audio`] and [`maybe_run_capture_subprocess`]).

/// Whether this build can capture microphone audio (the `audio` feature).

/// library. Bazel builds drop `audio` (no capture in the test sandbox).
